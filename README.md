<h1>Applying filters to SQL queries</h1>
As part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate programme I was given the opportunity to learn and practise using the SQL language within Linux. I was taught how to apply filters to SQL queries in order to generate specific information from a sample database, to meet the demands of the fictional scenarios provided by the programme. The attached file shows how I utilised different operators and wildcards to identify relevant information and patterns. This was a fun experience and has given me an insight into some of the methods cyber security professionals use to accomplish their tasks.
